Development
During the development of this website, several considerations were taken into account to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience. The main focus was on creating a clean and modern design that would engage visitors and effectively deliver the content. The website was designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

One of the challenges faced during development was implementing complex animations and transitions to enhance the overall user experience. This required careful optimization and testing to ensure smooth performance across different browsers and devices.

Additionally, accessibility was a top priority. The website was developed following web accessibility standards, including proper semantic HTML, alt tags for images, and keyboard navigation support.

Deployment
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages, a simple and free hosting service provided by GitHub. The deployment process involved the following steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub.
Push the website files to the repository.
Navigate to the repository's settings page.
In the GitHub Pages section, select the branch to deploy (e.g., the main branch).
Click on the Save button to save the changes.
After a few minutes, the website will be accessible at the provided GitHub Pages URL.
By utilizing GitHub Pages, the deployment process was streamlined, allowing for easy updates and version control.

Browser Compatibility
The website has been thoroughly tested for browser compatibility and is verified to work seamlessly on the following browsers:

Google Chrome (latest version)
Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
Safari (latest version)
Microsoft Edge (latest version)
Internet Explorer 11 (with some degradation in animations)
Users are recommended to use one of these browsers for the best experience. However, efforts were made to ensure basic functionality on older or less commonly used browsers as well.
